<caption>Nearly 97 percent of animal species are invertebrates, including this sea star (<emphasis effect="italics">Astropecten articulates</emphasis>) common to the eastern and southern coasts of the United States (credit: modification of work by Mark Walz)</caption></figure><para id="fs-idp27076880">A brief look at any magazine pertaining to our natural world, such as <emphasis effect="italics">National Geographic</emphasis>, would show a rich variety of vertebrates, especially mammals and birds. To most people, these are the animals that attract our attention. Concentrating on vertebrates, however, gives us a rather biased and limited view of biodiversity, because it ignores nearly 97 percent of the animal kingdom, namely the invertebrates. Invertebrate animals are those without a cranium and defined vertebral column or spine. In addition to lacking a spine, most invertebrates also lack an endoskeleton. A large number of invertebrates are aquatic animals, and scientific research suggests that many of the worldâ€™s species are aquatic invertebrates that have not yet been documented.</para></content>
