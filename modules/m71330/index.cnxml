      <title>THE HISTORY OF PHARMACEUTICAL REGULATIONS</title>
      <para id="import-auto-idm1241342448">As you just learned in this module, the exposure to a virus can sometimes provide immunity to future infections and is the basis for vaccination. Edward Jenner created the first vaccine in the 1770s, in an unusually unethical way. Small pox was a deadly disease in this time, and he had a theory about protecting people from infection. To test his theory, he gave a small box cowpox, then infected him with small pox. He was right – exposure to the cowpox had protected him from the small pox virus.</para>
      <para id="import-auto-idm1269022176">The artwork in the figure is titled <emphasis effect="italics">The Cow-Pock-or-the Wonderful Effects of the New Inoculation!</emphasis> By James Gillray in 1802. This cartoon is a caricature of a Smallpox and Inoculation Hospital at St. Pancras, showing cowpox vaccine administered to frightened young women, and cows emerging from different parts of people's bodies. The cartoon inspiration was the controversy over inoculating against the dreaded disease, smallpox. Opponents of vaccination had depicted cases of vaccines developing bovine features, and this is picked up and exaggerated by Gillray. Thanks to an aggressive vaccine campaign, the deadly smallpox virus was eradicated in the 80s. Unfortunately, the <link url="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6122668/">resurgence of anti-vaccination sentiment</link> in the U.S. (and worldwide) has returned resulting in unusual and preventable viral outbreaks causing grave concern of scientists globally. </para>

        <title>Consumer Safety and Health</title>
        <para id="import-auto-idm240670144">The idea of protecting the safety and health of consumers is not new. There were many societies, such as ancient Rome, where the penalties for producing an unsafe product were quite harsh. In contrast, our modern-day society's view of regulations and protections is that of prevention. Of course, there are still "after-the-fact" remedies available to the consumer. However, <emphasis effect="bold"><emphasis effect="italics">regulations in modern-day are designed to build quality and safety into the production process</emphasis></emphasis>, thereby limiting if not eliminating health and safety concerns before the product reaches the consumer. In this module, we will examine some of the most significant regulations, explore how regulations come to pass, and discuss the role of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in regulations of consumer products, especially those in health and wellness.  </para>

        <title>Regulatory Milestone of the FDA</title>
        <para id="import-auto-idm255012336">Pharmaceutical regulation aims to ensure objective characteristics such as safety, effectiveness, honesty in labeling, accurate reporting of side effects (if any). Regulations do not apply to subjective characteristics such as taste, color or texture. There are no regulations, for example, that dictate all aspirin tablets be white. Most of us take product quality for granted. It was not so long ago that substances such as cocaine could be used as ingredients in soda (Coca-Cola) or over-the-counter tonics (<link url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coca-Cola#Coca_%E2%80%93_cocaine">Wikipedia</link>). </para>

        <para id="import-auto-idm1211165520">The <emphasis effect="bold"><emphasis effect="italics">Durham-Humphrey Amendment</emphasis></emphasis>, passed in 1951, was the first federal law requiring a physician’s prescription for drugs “unsafe for self-medication.” </para>
        <para id="import-auto-idm227826144">The requirement that drugs are proven both safe and effective before release and that such effectiveness is supported by "substantial evidence" is the mandate of the <emphasis effect="bold"><emphasis effect="italics">Kefauver-Harris Amendments. </emphasis></emphasis></para>

        <para id="import-auto-idm1297624192">The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act, passed in 1984, made <emphasis effect="bold"><emphasis effect="italics">generic drugs </emphasis></emphasis>more readily available at the same time provided a way for businesses to recoup some prepatent research costs by factoring research time into the patent life of the drug. </para>

        <title>What Influences Pharmaceutical Regulations?</title>
        <para id="import-auto-idm1206825312">Two major influences trigger the enactment of regulations: 1. Consumer tragedy (serious injury, death) resulting from the use of a product, and 2. Advancements in science and technology. Once alerted to either of the above conditions, our lawmakers respond by passing the needed legislation, and enforcement of the law is assigned to the appropriate government agency. It’s important to note the FDA does not create laws, those are enacted by Congress, but they do enforce some of them. The issue of enforcement is not always clear-cut. Several agencies may enforce regulations in certain sectors – for example, Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs), are overseen by the EPA, FDA, and the USDA. Authority for oversight and regulation of the pharmaceutical industry, however, is quite clear - the primary agency is the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  </para>
