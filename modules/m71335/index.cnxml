  <md:title>Friedrich Miescher and the Structure of Nucleic Acids</md:title>
  <md:abstract>Johannes Friedrich Miescher (13 August 1844 – 26 August 1895) was a Swiss physician and biologist, and the first researcher to isolate nucleic acid. Friedrich Miescher raised the idea that the nucleic acids could be involved in heredity.</md:abstract>

Miescher isolated various phosphate-rich chemicals, which he called nuclein (now known as nucleic acids!), from the nuclei of white blood cells in 1869 in Felix Hoppe-Seyler's laboratory at the University of Tübingen, Germany, paving the way for the identification of DNA as the carrier of inheritance. The significance of the discovery, first published in 1871, was not at first apparent, and it was Albrecht Kossel who made the initial inquiries into its chemical structure.

      <para id="import-auto-idm215153232">After a typhus infection, Miescher lost hearing in one ear. Miescher felt that his partial deafness would be challenging as a doctor, so he turned to physiological chemistry. He originally wanted to study lymphocytes but was encouraged by Felix Hoppe-Seyler to study neutrophils. He was interested in studying the chemistry of the nucleus. Lymphocytes were difficult to obtain in enough numbers to study, while neutrophils were known to be one of the main and first components in pus and could be obtained from bandages at the nearby hospital. The problem was, however, washing the cells off the bandages without damaging them.</para>
      <para id="import-auto-idm763850000">Miescher devised different salt solutions, eventually producing one with sodium sulfate. The cells were filtered. Since centrifuges were not available at the time, the cells were left to settle to the bottom of a beaker. He then tried to isolate the nuclei free of cytoplasm. He subjected the purified nuclei to an alkaline extraction followed by acidification, resulting in the formation of a precipitate that Miescher called nuclein. He found that this contained phosphorus and nitrogen, but not sulfur. The discovery was so unlike anything else at the time that Hoppe-Seyler repeated all of Miescher's research himself before publishing it in his journal. Miescher then went on to study physiology at Leipzig in the laboratory of Carl Ludwig for a year before being appointed a professor of physiology.</para>
      <para id="import-auto-idm199172448">Although Miescher and his students aggressively researched nucleic acid chemistry, its function remained unknown. However, his discovery played an important part in the identification of nucleic acids as the carriers of inheritance. The importance of Miescher's discovery was not apparent until Albrecht Kossel, a German physiologist specializing in the physiological chemistry of the cell and its nucleus and of proteins researched its’ chemical structure.</para>
